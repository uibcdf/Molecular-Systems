    "The free particle is characterized for having no external potential goberning its motion. In the case of temperature and friction abscence the particle is moving in a uniform rectilineous trajectory. And when temperature and friction are present, we have nothing but a stochastic brownian particle or random walker characterized by magnitudes as diffusion."
